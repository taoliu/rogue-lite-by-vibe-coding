Descend through five dungeon floors collecting gear and gold. On floor 4 a friendly merchant offers powerful +3 equipment for a price, and on floor 5 a mighty boss guards a magical crystal. Defeat the boss and claim the crystal to win.

## 3D Rendering

The game now includes an experimental 3D renderer powered by [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). Tiles, the player, and monsters are displayed as simple cubes in a 3D scene. This work-in-progress feature replaces the original 2D canvas rendering and aims to give the dungeon a new perspective.
